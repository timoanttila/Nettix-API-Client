# Nettix REST API Client

The interface allows companies to automate the transfer of data from Nettix marketplace ads from the creation, editing, and publication to their deletion. The REST API implementation also provides an easy way to transfer the vehicle data of your store to your own use, for example to your website. The interface is only available for business customers.

PHP written bridge between the website and the interface to retrieve ads from Nettix marketplaces. Could be developed further to create, modify or delete data, but this current version only fetch information.
